Public Welfare Transportation Management 
Develop a system to optimize transportation routes and schedules in a city. (Finding Shortest Routes and Representing the transportation Network).

The system for optimizing transportation routes in a city focuses on finding the shortest routes and representing the transportation network efficiently. By gathering data on the city's transportation infrastructure and representing it as a graph, the system uses algorithms like Dijkstra's  to calculate the shortest path between two locations, considering factors such as distance, travel time.This system aims to improve transportation efficiency and reduce travel times for commuters, ultimately enhancing the overall transportation experience in the city.
