In urban environments, efficient transportation networks are vital for economic growth, environmental sustainability, and public welfare. However, traditional methods of designing and managing transportation systems often fall short in optimizing routes, minimizing congestion, and reducing environmental impacts. To address these challenges, this project aims to develop a Dynamic Systems Analysis (DSA) based transportation management system using graph theory. By leveraging graph algorithms and real-time data, the system will optimize route planning, and resource allocation, leading to enhanced efficiency, reduced environmental footprint, and improved overall urban mobility.
