OVERVIEW

This C code representsa simple tourism management system designated to assist users in planning
and organizing their travel arrangements.This online portal provides a basic framework for
managing tourism activities,allowing users to select destinations,compare them,choose travel
options,and generate reciepts.It begins with structure definitions and global variable
declarations,followed by function declarations for various tasks like displaying headins,managing
details,presenting travel options,and generating reciepts.

DATA STRUCTURES USED

1.STRUCTURES('struct')

The code utilizes structures to manage and organize related data under one entity.These structures
are used to store details such as passenger information,travel detsils,destination options,travel
routes
.
2.ARRAYS

• An array of 'Destination' structures to hold information about all possible travel
destinations.

• Prices in the function compare: This 2D array contains the prices of different categories
(accommodation, food, activities, and travel) for each city. It is used to print the
comparison table and calculate the total cost of a city.

• TravelData: This 3D array contains the prices and travel times for different modes of
transportation (bus, train, and flight) for each city. It is used to print the travel options and
calculate the travel cost.

3.LINKED LISTS

The linked list is used to store and manage passenger information.The use of linked lists in the
tourism management system enables dynamic data management where the volume of data is
variable and operations are frequently required.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

• C Programming
• Command prompt


FEATURES

• The code allows the user to compare the prices of two destinations based on their
category (beaches, mountains, desert, city, countryside, or pilgrimage). This feature helps
the user make an informed decision about which destination to choose based on their
budget.
