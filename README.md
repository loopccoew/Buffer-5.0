# Buffer-5.0
team 4- solution seekers: 
To create an user friendly website through which aids provided by the government can reach the people in need. The website will display a list government schemes that apply to you according to your credentials. This is set to form a bridge between the government and general public to make all the official information accessible.

Data Structures used:
1.Dictionary (schemes):
This dictionary stores information about various schemes indexed by their names.
Each scheme name is associated with a description.
Example: schemes = {"1.Agnipath scheme": "For recruitment of soldiers below the rank..."}
2.Dictionary (u_p):
This dictionary stores user IDs and their corresponding passwords.
Used for user authentication and management.
Example: u_p = {"maitreyi": "joshi"}
3.List (applied):
This list stores the names of schemes that a user has applied for.
Used to track which schemes a user has applied for during the program execution.
Example: applied = ["Battery operated TriCycle", "Mahila samman savings certificate"]
4.The code uses while loops to create a menu-driven interface for both admin and user interactions. Depending on the user's choice, they can either view existing records, add data (such as adding new schemes), or perform other actions like logging in, signing up, or changing passwords.
