Theme: Public welfare.
Project Description:
Our module has 3 login interfaces: Customer, Supplier and Admin.
The user can login or sign up into their respective interface(all validations are provided accordingly).
The customer data is stored in a hash-table with the customer id as key and the remaining attributes as value. 
Once the user has logged in as a customer he/she will be provided with the following options:
1.Order Medicines
2.Recent Orders
3.Update details
4.LogOut

Medicines will be supplied to the customer from the nearest supplier based on location(which we have considered to be the pin code of the customer).
As soon as the bill is generated for the purchased medicines the order is added to queue(pending deliveries) on the supplier side.
Supplier:-
The supplier and medicine data is stored in the database. The supplier is provided with the following options: 
1.Add Medicines
2.Update Medicine Quantity
3.Delete Medicine
4.Display All Information
5.Pending Deliveries
6.Deliver Orders
7.LogOut


Admin:
The admin can access the supplier as well as the customer side by performing the following functionalities:
1.Display All Customers
2.Add Customer
3.Delete Customer
