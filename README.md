Problem Statement: Design and implement a Hospital Management System (HMS) using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to enhance operational efficiency and streamline various hospital processes. 

Features:
1.Patient Registration: Implement a system for registering patients efficiently, storing personal details using optimized data structures.

2.Appointment Scheduling: Develop algorithms to schedule appointments based on doctor availability, patient priority, and urgency, ensuring efficient use of resources.

3.Laboratory Reports Management: Utilize DSA techniques to manage patient's laboratory reports.


4.Billing: Implement algorithms for accurate billing based on services availed by patients, ensuring proper calculation and tracking of charges.

5.Staff Management: Develop modules for managing hospital staff, including rostering, shift scheduling, and performance tracking, utilizing efficient data structures.

6.Resource Optimization: Utilize algorithms to optimize bed allocation, operating room scheduling.

Data structures used :
1.Hashmap-for storing patients ,doctor ,nurses data so that we can access their data using key i.e id.  

2.Priority Queue-for storing the emergency cases in each department so that they will be given priority first and other appointments will be scheduled later .

3.ArrayList-for number of patients to be admitted/discharged as they donâ€™t have fix number.

4.Array of Objects-it is used for allocating the bed for the patient admitted in particular ward as the number of beds in ward are fixed .
