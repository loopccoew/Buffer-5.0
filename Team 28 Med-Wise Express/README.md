Team 28 Med-Wise Express

We have made an Online Medicine Delivery System in which people can input their details and medicines will be delivered to their homes. There are 5 options, inserting new customer details, updating customer details, view specific patient details, deleting a particular medicine from a patient's prescription, seeing how much time it will take for mdeicine delivery.
